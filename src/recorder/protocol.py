## CRITICAL RULE: ONE SCENE = ONE RECORDING

**NEVER record one long continuous video for an entire demo.**

WHY: Audio-video sync only works per-scene. If you record a 2-minute video and
generate a 90-second audio, the ENTIRE video plays at 1.3x speed - making some
parts too fast and others out of sync with narration.

**CORRECT approach:**
```
Scene 1: start_recording() -> actions -> stop_recording() -> audio -> sync
Scene 2: start_recording() -> actions -> stop_recording() -> audio -> sync
Scene 3: start_recording() -> actions -> stop_recording() -> audio -> sync
Final:   concatenate_videos([scene1, scene2, scene3])
```

**WRONG approach:**
```
start_recording()
[all demo actions for 2+ minutes]
stop_recording()
# Now audio sync is impossible!
```

Each scene should be 10-30 seconds. Stop and restart recording for each logical
section, even if continuing on the same page.

---

## Container Environment

This runs in Docker with Xvfb virtual display. The browser (Firefox) renders to
display :99 and is always recordable. No visibility issues exist.

Use start_recording() and stop_recording() - they capture real video at 30fps.
Do NOT use screenshots or Playwright's built-in video.

---

## Core Workflow: Per-Scene Process

Complete EACH scene fully before starting the next:

```
SCENE N:
1. PRE-SCREENSHOT   - browser_snapshot() - verify starting position
2. START RECORDING  - start_recording()
3. PERFORM ACTIONS  - scroll, click, type DURING recording
4. STOP RECORDING   - stop_recording()
5. POST-SCREENSHOT  - browser_snapshot() - verify ending state
6. WRITE SCRIPT     - Describe the action and result
7. GENERATE AUDIO   - text_to_speech(script)
8. SYNC             - adjust_video_to_audio()
9. NEXT SCENE       - Repeat for scene N+1
```

## CRITICAL: Actions DURING Recording, Not Before

**WRONG** - Static boring video:
```python
browser_scroll(...)           # Action happens BEFORE recording
browser_click(...)            # Viewer sees nothing
start_recording()             # Records static result
browser_wait_for(time=3)
stop_recording()              # Boring! No motion captured
```

**CORRECT** - Dynamic engaging video:
```python
start_recording()             # Start FIRST
browser_wait_for(time=2)      # Brief pause
browser_scroll(...)           # Action captured on video!
browser_wait_for(time=2)      # Viewer sees result
stop_recording()              # Exciting! Motion captured
```

The whole point of video is to show MOTION. If you do actions before recording,
you're just taking an expensive screenshot.

Why this order:
- Video captures the ACTION, not just the result
- Viewers see what's happening, not just what happened
- Script describes the motion: "Watch as we scroll down..."

---

## Demo Structure

One demo = multiple scenes. Each scene = one recording + one audio file.

```
Demo: "Product Tour"
  Scene 1: Homepage intro       - 15s video, 15s audio
  Scene 2: Feature overview     - 20s video, 18s audio  
  Scene 3: Click-through demo   - 25s video, 22s audio
  Scene 4: Conclusion           - 10s video, 12s audio
  Final:   Concatenate all      - ~70s total
```

Scene duration guidelines:
| Type              | Duration    |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Intro             | 10-15s      |
| Simple action     | 15-25s      |
| Complex workflow  | 20-30s      |
| Conclusion        | 10-15s      |

**MAX scene length: 30 seconds.** Longer scenes = harder to sync audio.

---

## Per-Scene Template

```
SCENE N: [Name] (target: 15-25 seconds)

A. PRE-RECORD (outside recording)
   browser_snapshot()                    # Verify starting position
   # Do NOT perform actions here - they won't be recorded!

B. RECORD (actions happen HERE)
   start_recording(output_path="sceneN_raw.mp4")
   browser_wait_for(time=2)              # Viewer sees starting state
   # === ACTION HERE - THIS IS WHAT GETS RECORDED ===
   # scroll, click, hover, type - all captured on video
   browser_wait_for(time=2)              # Viewer sees result
   stop_recording()

C. POST-RECORD (outside recording)
   browser_snapshot()                    # Verify ending state

D. SCRIPT
   Describe the ACTION: "Watch as we scroll..." "Clicking here reveals..."

E. AUDIO
   text_to_speech(text="...", output_path="sceneN_audio.mp3")

F. SYNC
   adjust_video_to_audio(...)

G. NEXT SCENE
```

**CRITICAL: Actions between start_recording() and stop_recording() are captured.
Actions before start_recording() are NOT captured - the video would be static.**

---

## When to Split Scenes

Split into separate scenes when:
- Showing a different feature
- Navigating to a new page  
- Performing a different type of action
- Narration focus changes

Example - BAD (one long recording):
```
start_recording()
[scroll page, click button, fill form, submit, show results]
stop_recording()
# 90 second video - impossible to sync narration!
```

Example - GOOD (multiple scenes):
```
Scene 1: Scroll to feature section (15s)
Scene 2: Click button, show modal (20s)
Scene 3: Fill form fields (20s)
Scene 4: Submit and show results (15s)
# Each scene synced to its own narration
```

---

## Script Guidelines

- Conversational tone
- 15-25 seconds per scene (matches video length)
- Describe what viewer sees
- Match narration timing to action timing

---

## Final Assembly

After ALL scenes recorded and synced:
```
concatenate_videos(
    video_paths=["scene1_final.mp4", "scene2_final.mp4", ...],
    output_path="demo_final.mp4"
)
```

## REMINDER: Real Video Recording Works

Use start_recording() and stop_recording() - they produce REAL video files.
Do NOT fall back to screenshots. Do NOT use Playwright video features.

The container has Xvfb (virtual display) which makes the browser recordable.
This is not a workaround - this is the intended, working approach.

---

## Container Environment

Xvfb virtual display at :99, resolution 2560x1440 (plenty of headroom).
Firefox browser renders to this display with NO window decorations.
Recording captures via FFmpeg x11grab.

## Browser Sizing

Use standard video resolutions for best results:
- 1920x1080 (1080p) - Recommended for most demos
- 1280x720 (720p) - Good for smaller file sizes

Call browser_resize(width=1920, height=1080) BEFORE recording.
Dimensions are auto-rounded to even numbers (FFmpeg requirement).

## Simple Recording Flow

1. browser_navigate(url)     # Opens browser
2. browser_resize(1920, 1080)  # Set video size
3. start_recording()         # Auto-detects browser - no args needed!
4. [perform demo actions]
5. stop_recording()          # Saves video

---

## One-Time Setup (Start of Demo)

Execute these steps IN ORDER before recording any steps:

```
1. NAVIGATE FIRST (creates the browser window)
   browser_navigate(url="https://your-target-site.com")
   # CRITICAL: Browser window only exists AFTER navigation
   # Without this step, list_windows() will find nothing

2. RESIZE BROWSER
   browser_resize(width=1920, height=1080)

3. VERIFY WINDOW EXISTS
   list_windows()
   # Expected output includes: Firefox - [page title]
   # If empty: You forgot step 1 (navigate). Go back.

4. VERIFY CONTENT
   browser_snapshot()
   # Examine: Is correct page showing? Is content visible?
```

IMPORTANT: The Firefox window does NOT exist until browser_navigate() is called.
If list_windows() returns empty, ensure you navigated to a URL first.

---

## Recording Configuration

```python
start_recording(
    window_title="Firefox",           # From list_windows() output
    output_path="stepN_raw.mp4"       # Saved to /app/recordings/
)
```

The tool automatically:
- Captures the Firefox window from Xvfb
- Uses 30fps
- Detects window dimensions

---

## Per-Step Verification

Before EACH recording:
```
1. browser_snapshot()              # Capture current state
2. Examine screenshot              # Verify correct content
3. IF wrong content:
   - Navigate/scroll to fix
   - Re-take snapshot
   - Re-verify
4. ONLY record when content verified
```

After EACH recording:
```
1. browser_snapshot()              # Capture end state
2. Examine screenshot              # Verify recording captured intended content
3. IF wrong:
   - Delete recording
   - Re-record step
```

# Phase 3: Recording Actions

What to do DURING recording for engaging demos. Call after setup_phase_2().
Next phase: editing_phase_4()

---

## CRITICAL: Keep Scenes SHORT

**Each recording should be 10-30 seconds max.**

Why: Audio sync adjusts playback speed. A 60-second video synced to 30-second
audio plays at 2x speed (too fast). A 15-second video synced to 20-second
audio plays at 0.75x (slightly slow, looks natural).

**Stop recording frequently.** It's better to have 6 short scenes than 1 long one.

---

## Recording Pattern

**ALL actions happen INSIDE the recording:**

```
1. Verify position (snapshot BEFORE recording)
2. START recording
3. WAIT 2s (viewer sees initial state)
4. PERFORM action (scroll, click, type) - THIS IS RECORDED
5. WAIT 2s (viewer absorbs result)
6. STOP recording
7. SYNC with audio before next scene
```

## WRONG vs CORRECT

**WRONG** - Action outside recording (static video):
```python
browser_scroll(400)           # NOT RECORDED - wasted!
start_recording()
browser_wait_for(time=5)      # Just shows static page
stop_recording()
```

**CORRECT** - Action inside recording (dynamic video):
```python
start_recording()
browser_wait_for(time=2)
browser_scroll(400)           # RECORDED - viewer sees motion!
browser_wait_for(time=2)
stop_recording()
```

**Rule: If you want viewers to SEE an action, it must happen DURING recording.**

---

## Scrolling

Use browser_evaluate for smooth scrolling:

```python
# Scroll by fixed amount (recommended)
browser_evaluate(function='() => { window.scrollBy({ top: 400, behavior: "smooth" }); }')
browser_wait_for(time=2)  # ALWAYS wait after scroll

# Scroll to element
browser_evaluate(function='() => { document.querySelector("#section").scrollIntoView({ behavior: "smooth" }); }')
browser_wait_for(time=2)

# Scroll to top
browser_evaluate(function='() => { window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: "smooth" }); }')
browser_wait_for(time=2)
```

Scroll amounts:
- Small reveal: 200-300px
- Section jump: 400-500px
- Full page: 600-800px

CRITICAL: Always call browser_wait_for(time=2) after scrolling.

---

## Clicking

```python
# Hover then click for visibility
browser_hover(ref="...", element="Submit button")
browser_wait_for(time=1)
browser_click(ref="...", element="Submit button")
browser_wait_for(time=2)  # Wait for result
```

---

## Typing

```python
# Type with slowly=True for character-by-character
browser_type(ref="...", text="hello@example.com", slowly=True)
browser_wait_for(time=1)  # Pause to show completed input
```

---

## Complete Scene Example

```python
# === SCENE 1: Scroll to features ===

browser_snapshot()  # Verify starting position (NOT recorded)

# RECORDING STARTS - all actions now captured
start_recording(output_path="scene1_raw.mp4")
browser_wait_for(time=2)                    # Viewer sees starting state
browser_evaluate(function='() => { window.scrollBy({ top: 400, behavior: "smooth" }); }')
browser_wait_for(time=2)                    # Viewer sees scroll complete
stop_recording()
# RECORDING ENDS

browser_snapshot()  # Verify ending position (NOT recorded)

text_to_speech(
    text="As we scroll down, you can see the main features of our platform...",
    output_path="scene1_audio.mp3"
)

adjust_video_to_audio(
    video_path="scene1_raw.mp4",
    audio_path="scene1_audio.mp3",
    output_path="scene1_final.mp4"
)

# === SCENE 2: Click button and see result ===

browser_snapshot()  # Verify position

# RECORDING STARTS
start_recording(output_path="scene2_raw.mp4")
browser_wait_for(time=2)
browser_hover(ref="...", element="Learn More")  # Hover captured!
browser_wait_for(time=1)
browser_click(ref="...", element="Learn More")  # Click captured!
browser_wait_for(time=3)                         # Result captured!
stop_recording()
# RECORDING ENDS

browser_snapshot()

text_to_speech(
    text="Clicking Learn More opens the detailed view with all specifications...",
    output_path="scene2_audio.mp3"
)

adjust_video_to_audio(
    video_path="scene2_raw.mp4",
    audio_path="scene2_audio.mp3",
    output_path="scene2_final.mp4"
)

# === FINAL: Concatenate all scenes ===
concatenate_videos(
    video_paths=["scene1_final.mp4", "scene2_final.mp4"],
    output_path="demo_final.mp4"
)
```

**Notice:** Every scroll, hover, and click happens BETWEEN start_recording and stop_recording.

---

## Timing Guidelines

| Action               | Wait After |
|----------------------|------------|
| Scroll               | 2-3s       |
| Click                | 2-3s       |
| Type                 | 1-2s       |
| Page navigation      | 3-4s       |
| Animation/transition | 2-3s       |
| Key content display  | 3-5s       |

---

## Mistakes to Avoid

| Problem                  | Fix                                    |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Actions before recording** | **Move actions AFTER start_recording()** |
| Static/boring video      | Do scroll/click/type DURING recording  |
| No pauses between actions| Add browser_wait_for() after each action|
| Rushed content           | Pause 3-5s on key information          |
| Scroll without waiting   | Always wait 2s after scroll            |
| Skipped verification     | Snapshot before and after recording    |

**#1 Mistake:** Performing actions before start_recording() and wondering why 
the video is static. The recording only captures what happens AFTER it starts.

---

## Verification Workflow

BEFORE recording:
```
browser_snapshot()           # Capture state
# Examine: Is correct content visible?
# IF NO: Navigate/scroll, re-snapshot
# IF YES: Proceed to record
```

AFTER recording:
```
browser_snapshot()           # Capture end state  
# Examine: Did recording capture intended content?
# IF NO: Delete recording, re-record
# IF YES: Proceed to audio sync
```

---

## Failure Recovery

If recording captures wrong content:
1. STOP - do not continue
2. DELETE the bad recording
3. Navigate to correct content
4. Re-verify with snapshot
5. Re-record entire step

---

## CRITICAL: Process Each Scene Before Recording Next

The workflow is SCENE-BY-SCENE, not batch:

```
CORRECT (process each scene fully):
  Record Scene 1 -> Script 1 -> Audio 1 -> Sync 1
  Record Scene 2 -> Script 2 -> Audio 2 -> Sync 2
  Record Scene 3 -> Script 3 -> Audio 3 -> Sync 3
  Concatenate all

WRONG (batch approach):
  Record Scene 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...
  Write all scripts
  Generate all audio
  Try to sync (FAILS - out of sync!)
```

Why scene-by-scene:
- Audio length controls video speed via adjust_video_to_audio()
- Script is based on what you JUST recorded
- Errors caught immediately, not at the end

---

## Per-Scene Assembly Workflow

```
For EACH scene (do not skip ahead):
1. RECORD      -> sceneN_raw.mp4 (10-30 seconds)
2. SCREENSHOT  -> Capture end state
3. SCRIPT      -> Write 15-25 second narration based on screenshots
4. AUDIO       -> text_to_speech() -> sceneN_audio.mp3
5. SYNC        -> adjust_video_to_audio() -> sceneN_final.mp4
6. VERIFY      -> media_info() - confirm video matches audio duration
7. NEXT        -> Only NOW record scene N+1
```

Do NOT record multiple scenes before syncing. Sync each scene immediately.

---

## Script Writing

Write scripts AFTER recording, based on screenshots:

```python
# You have:
# - Pre-recording screenshot (starting state)
# - stepN_raw.mp4 (the recording)
# - Post-recording screenshot (ending state)

# Script describes the visual journey:
script = (
    "Here we see [pre-screenshot content]. "
    "Now we [action performed]. "
    "As you can see, [post-screenshot content]."
)

text_to_speech(text=script, output_path="stepN_audio.mp3")
```

---

## Audio-Video Sync

adjust_video_to_audio() speeds up or slows down video to match audio duration.
It NEVER cuts/trims - all visual content is preserved.

```python
adjust_video_to_audio(
    video_path="stepN_raw.mp4",
    audio_path="stepN_audio.mp3",
    output_path="stepN_final.mp4"
)

# Verify
media_info(file_path="stepN_final.mp4")
```

---

## Final Concatenation

After all steps are synced:

```python
concatenate_videos(
    video_paths=[
        "step1_final.mp4",
        "step2_final.mp4",
        "step3_final.mp4"
    ],
    output_path="demo_final.mp4"
)

# Verify final video
media_info(file_path="demo_final.mp4")
```

---

## File Structure

```
/app/recordings/
  step1_raw.mp4
  step1_audio.mp3
  step1_final.mp4
  step2_raw.mp4
  step2_audio.mp3
  step2_final.mp4
  ...
  demo_final.mp4
```

## Common Issues

| Issue                      | Fix                                          |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Audio/video out of sync**| **Scene too long! Keep recordings under 30s**|
| Video plays too fast       | Recording was too long for the audio         |
| Video plays too slow       | Recording was too short (ok, adds pause)     |
| Window not found           | Run list_windows(), use correct pattern      |
| Wrong content recorded     | Verify with snapshot before recording        |

**The #1 cause of sync problems is recording too long.** Split into shorter scenes.

---

## Error Recovery

If step N fails:
1. Keep completed steps (1 to N-1)
2. Delete failed step N files
3. Re-record step N
4. Continue with N+1
